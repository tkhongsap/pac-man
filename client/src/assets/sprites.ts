// This file would normally contain sprite loading logic,
// but since we're drawing everything programmatically with Canvas API,
// we don't need to load any sprite sheets.

/**
 * For a full game we would define sprite sheet coordinates here

 * drawing, this file serves as a placeholder for future expansion.

// Example of how sprite definitions would look:
/*
export const SPRITE_SHEET_URL = '/textures/pacman-sprites.png';

export const SPRITES = {

    ],
    LEFT: [
      { x: 0, y: 16, width: 16, height: 16 },
